# Using Sequelize ORM with Express

This project is an example project from the [Using Sequelize ORM With Express](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introducing-the-project-21) on Treehouse.

## Extensions

I have added several extensions to this project

- Added comments to articles.
- Added comment counts on the /articles page.

Currently, I'm working on the following extensions:

- adding pagination to the results in /articles
- adding user authentication (possibly adding later)
